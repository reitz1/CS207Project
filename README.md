Stock Price Display for Multiple Stocks Using Arduino

The purpose of this project is to build a display for stock prices.  Stock prices can change by the second.  For some people, this is very important in their jobs, and for others, monitoring the stock market can be a hobby or important for their personal finances.  My idea is to create a device that has a keypad to input the stock symbol and the device will in return display the real-time price as it changes.  Ideally, I’d like to be able to input any stock symbol, rather then “preloading” the machine with only a handful of stocks.  This would allow someone to look up any stock they’re interested in.
